# Job Matcher Application Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the blueprint for the Job Matcher application, a web-based platform designed to help Professionals, Managers, Executives, and Technicians (PMETs) in Singapore find relevant job opportunities. The application will use AI to analyze user resumes and match them with a curated list of job openings.

## Implemented Features

*   **Modern User Interface:** The application is built with React and Material-UI, featuring a custom theme with a clean and professional design. The color palette, typography, and component styling have been customized to create a unique and visually appealing user experience.
*   **Responsive Layout:** The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The use of Material-UI's grid system and responsive design principles guarantees that the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
*   **Routing and Navigation:** The application uses `react-router-dom` to manage navigation between pages. A persistent layout with a navigation bar allows users to easily switch between the Home, Job Listings, and Resume Analysis sections.
*   **Home Page:** A visually engaging home page with a hero section that encourages users to upload their resumes. It features a call-to-action button that directs users to the Resume Analysis page.
*   **Resume Analysis Page:** A user-friendly interface for uploading resumes. It includes a drag-and-drop file input that supports PDF and DOCX formats. The page is designed to guide the user through the resume submission process.
*   **Job Listings Page:** A page that displays a list of recommended job opportunities. The jobs are presented in a card-based layout, showing the job title, company, location, and a match percentage. This page is currently populated with mock data.

## Current Plan

I have finished setting up the project, and now I will await for further instructions.
